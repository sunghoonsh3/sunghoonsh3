<h1>üëã Hi, I'm Tristan!</h1>

**I develop Innovative Products**

Innovating cool products and solving tricky problems with a fresh twist is what I do best. Think of me as the small Totoro‚Äîbouncy, full of life, and always curious. I have a knack for diving into the weird and wonderful, turning quirky ideas into reality.
